This is a machine learning model called the Smart & Sustainable Crop Advisor.

It's designed to solve agricultural uncertainty by helping farmers choose the right crop for their specific land and weather conditions, preventing wasted resources and improving yields. The model analyzes soil nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, along with local temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to predict the most suitable crop with high accuracy.

What makes this machine learning model unique is its "Smart Soil Advisor" feature, which goes beyond prediction to provide an actionable plan on how to prepare the soil to grow a desired crop. To support sustainable farming, every recommendation comes with insights on water usage and soil health. For maximum accessibility, especially for farmers with varying literacy levels, the advice is also delivered through a clear voice output.

The core of the system is a powerful XGBoost model built in Python, and the interactive tool was created using the Gradio framework. The goal of this model is to provide farmers with data-driven, easy-to-understand guidance to make farming more profitable and environmentally friendly.
